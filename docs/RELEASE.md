# Release pipelines

GitHub Actions are split by purpose:

- `Pull Request Checks` builds the app and runs unit/UI tests for pull requests.
- `Unsigned IPA` is the only IPA build. It runs on every branch push, on `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`
  tags, and on manual runs. A version tag also publishes that IPA as the GitHub release.
- `TestFlight` is a manual signed build and upload to App Store Connect.
- `Release` runs for `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` tags and only uploads that version to TestFlight.
  It does not build another IPA.

The GitHub run ID plus retry attempt is used as `CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION`. It is shared
by all jobs in a release, increases on a retry, and avoids collisions between the
standalone TestFlight and release workflows.

## Repository configuration

Add the public Apple Developer Team ID as a GitHub Actions repository variable:

- `APPLE_TEAM_ID`

Add these GitHub Actions secrets:

- `APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_KEY_ID`
- `APP_STORE_CONNECT_ISSUER_ID`
- `APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_PRIVATE_KEY` — the complete contents of the downloaded `.p8` file
- `SIGNING_REPO_SSH_KEY` — the application-specific read-only deploy key for the private
  `h33h/apple-signing-assets` repository

Certificates, P12 passwords, and provisioning profiles are stored only inside the
per-application age-encrypted bundle in `apple-signing-assets`. The deploy key also acts
as the age identity, so iADB can clone the central repository and decrypt only its own
bundle. No `.p12`, password, or `.mobileprovision` GitHub secret is needed.

Until `teams/Y743CZ57S7/apps/com.iadb.app/app-store/signing-assets.tar.age` exists, the
workflow uses App Store Connect automatic signing. Once the bundle is provisioned, the
same workflow switches to manual signing. A present but invalid bundle fails the build;
it never silently falls back.

Use an App Store Connect team API key with the Admin role and access to Certificates,
Identifiers & Profiles. The same API credentials are required by the central repository's
`Provision signing assets` workflow to issue and rotate encrypted assets.

## Running a release

For a TestFlight-only build, run the `TestFlight` workflow and enter the marketing version.
For a full release, push a semantic version tag:

```bash
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
```

Pushing the tag starts `Unsigned IPA`, which publishes the GitHub release, and `Release`,
which uploads to TestFlight. TestFlight still needs the Apple secrets below and does not
block the IPA or the GitHub release.

Before tagging, complete App Store Connect metadata, privacy labels, export-compliance
documentation, screenshots, support and privacy-policy URLs, and reviewer instructions.
